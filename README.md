# Temperatures
Assignment 11 submitted via Blackboard for C# class.

Demonstrates basic knowledge of working with arrays.

Also demonstrates usage of class-level variables.

Output is kinda funky (sometimes tab-indented and sometimes not)
but I did it that way to match the problem specification exactly.

## Example output
